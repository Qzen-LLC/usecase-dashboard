  name: Realistic but incorrect content generation
  description: Generative models can produce text that looks polished and authoritative
    but is factually wrong. These errors are more likely to be believed because of
    the natural writing style. This increases misinformation risks and misinformed
    decision-making.

  name: Highly plausible hallucinations
  description: Hallucinations in generative models often appear coherent and detailed,
    making them harder to detect. Users may adopt them as truth, causing cascading
    errors in workflows. This is especially dangerous in compliance-heavy domains.

  description: Generative AI enables rapid creation of harmful media such as phishing
    emails, impersonations or fraud campaigns. Attackers gain efficiency and sophistication
    with minimal effort.

  name: Unintentional disclosure of sensitive training patterns
  description: Generative models may reproduce phrases, structures or snippets that
    resemble sensitive training data. This happens even without explicit memorization
    and creates privacy/legal risk.

  name: Self-reinforcing generative drift
  description: When generative outputs are fed back into systems as new data, the
    model begins amplifying its own artifacts and distortions. This causes long-term
