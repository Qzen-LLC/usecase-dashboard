# Performance Optimizations Summary

This document summarizes the key performance improvements made to the QZEN Use Case Dashboard codebase to ensure faster load times and a better user experience.

---

## 1. Dynamic Imports & Code Splitting
- **SidebarLayout** is now dynamically imported in the main layout using `next/dynamic`, reducing the initial JavaScript bundle size and speeding up first load.

## 2. Image Optimization
- All `<img>` tags for the logo in the sidebar were replaced with the Next.js `<Image>` component, enabling automatic image optimization and responsive loading.

## 3. Dependency Cleanup
- Removed unused dependencies from `package.json` and ran `npm install` to clean up `node_modules`:
  - `@fontsource/montserrat`, `@fontsource/open-sans`, `@fontsource/raleway`, `@fontsource/source-sans-pro`
  - `@radix-ui/react-avatar`, `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`
  - `next-themes`, `react-window`, `date-fns`, `dotenv`
- This reduces bundle size and improves build and load times.

## 4. Memoization of Components
- Wrapped the following components with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
  - `VendorAssessment`
  - `LazyChart`
- This is especially beneficial for components rendering large lists or charts.

## 5. API Route Caching
- Added `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=30, stale-while-revalidate=120` headers to key API routes:
  - `/api/get-finops`
  - `/api/get-usecase`
  - `/api/read-usecases`
- This enables browsers and CDNs to cache responses for 30 seconds and serve stale data while revalidating for up to 2 minutes, improving repeated load performance.

---

**Result:**
- The website now loads significantly faster, with reduced JavaScript bundle size, optimized images, fewer dependencies, more efficient rendering, and improved API response times.
